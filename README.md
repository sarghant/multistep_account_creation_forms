# multistep_account_creation_forms
A 3 step form consisting of fluid animations / transitions that are triggered when going back and forth between said steps. HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS with modern syntax.

I built this after coming across WebDevSimplified's video (will leave the link down below) which was based on someone else's work on Codepen. The video was primarily focused on the funcionality (JS code) of switching between the forms and had minimal styling (which wasn't the goal anyway). It made me want to build the whole thing while replicating the design of the original project, but while also making the animations more comprehensive like adding smooth completion of progress steps.
